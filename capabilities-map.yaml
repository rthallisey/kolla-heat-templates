# This file holds metadata about the capabilities of the tripleo-heat-templates
# repository for deployment using puppet. It groups configuration by topic,
# describes possible combinations of environments and resource capabilities.

# root_template: identifies repository's root template
# root_environment: identifies root_environment, this one is special in terms of
#   order in which the environments are merged before deploying. This one serves as
#   a base and it's parameters/resource_registry gets overriden by other environments
#   if used.

# environment_groups:
# Identifies an environment choice. If group includes multiple environments it
# indicates that environments in group are mutually exclusive.
